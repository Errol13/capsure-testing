# Capsure - Manual Test Cases Documentation

This repository contains structured manual test cases for the **Capsure** project â€” a capstone application designed to connect freelancers and clients for event-based services.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this documentation is to:
- Demonstrate my understanding of test design based on real user stories.
- Present detailed, modular, and professional-quality test cases.
- Prepare for future automation using tools like **Selenium** and **Robot Framework**.

## ðŸ§© Structure

The test cases are organized by **user role** (Freelancer, Client, Admin) and by **feature module** (e.g., Account Management, Messaging, Services).
